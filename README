## About The Project

This project serves as the central nervous system for the AI Smart Glass. It is built with a modern Java stack, designed for high performance, security, and scalability. The backend exposes a set of APIs for the smart glass to interact with, managing everything from user data to AI model interactions.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using a robust and modern technology stack:

- **Backend:**
  - ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring_Boot-F2F4F9?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring-boot)
  - ![Spring Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring_Security-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)
- **Authentication:**
  - ![JWT](https://img.shields.io/badge/JWT-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=json-web-tokens&logoColor=white) (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database:**
  - ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
- **DevOps & Containerization:**
  - ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
  - ![Jenkins](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jenkins-D24939?style=for-the-badge&logo=jenkins&logoColor=white)
  - ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)

## Features

- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- **RESTful API:** A comprehensive set of endpoints for managing users, device data, and more.
- **Data Persistence:** Reliable data storage and management with Spring Data JPA and MySQL.
- **Containerized:** Fully containerized with Docker for consistent development and production environments.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to be deployed and managed with Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose
- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or later
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/moshangAAA/aiglass-backend.git
    cd aiglass-backend
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other environment-specific settings.

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    This is the recommended way to run the application as it sets up all the required services (backend, database, etc.).
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables, which are defined in the `.env` file. This file is loaded at runtime and should not be committed to version control.

| Variable                   | Description                                  | Default      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`    | The connection URL for the MySQL database.   | `jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/aiglass_db` |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` | The username for the database.               | `username`   |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | The password for the database.               | `password`   |
| `REDIS_HOST`               | The hostname for the Redis server.           | `redis`      |
| `REDIS_PORT`               | The port for the Redis server.               | `6379`       |

## Usage

The API provides several endpoints to interact with the backend services. API documentation can be generated and exposed using tools like Swagger.

*(Example: A placeholder for future API documentation)*
- `GET /api/v1/users` - Retrieves a list of users.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.

## DevOps & Deployment

### CI/CD

This project is configured with a CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**. The `Jenkinsfile` (to be created) in the root directory will define the build, test, and deployment stages. The pipeline automates:
1.  Code checkout
2.  Unit & Integration Testing
3.  Building the Docker image
4.  Pushing the image to a container registry
5.  Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster

### Kubernetes (K8s)

The application is designed to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. Deployment manifests (e.g., `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`) should be created to manage the application's lifecycle, scaling, and networking within the cluster.
